            <p>
                Early interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum lead me to learn about blockchain technology.
                I learned about DeFi(decentralized finance) and became a cryptocurrency investor.
                I incorporated my coding skills to self learn blockchain development and taught myself 
                the Solidity programming language for the EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine). Other technologies
                I learned are Web3.js, Ethers.js, Truffle, and Hardhat.  I also learned React.js for
                front end development and design. Now I am seeking a development job in the Web3 industry.
